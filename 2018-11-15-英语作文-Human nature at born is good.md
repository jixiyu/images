##  标题：Human nature at born is good?


----------

1.当一个孩子出生来到这个世界的时候，他到底是本善还是本恶？我们可以看到，古代原始人已经懂得用火把同类烤着吃，这是多么凶残。面对着原始人这种凶残的天性，难道我们还要说人性本善吗？所以，我认为人性本恶。


----------

When a child is born into the world, whether he is good or evil? We can see that the ancient primitive people already knew how to roast the partners , which is so cruel. Faced with the cruel nature of primitive people, should we still say that human nature is good? Therefore, I think that human nature is evil.

2.要是人性本善，为什么这个社会还需要道德来制约呢。正是因为人性本恶，所以在人类社会的演进过程中，道德与教化才会显得如此必要。每个人可以通过提高自身的修养，从而对人性加以改变，甚至最后形成伟大的人格。


If human nature is good, why does the society still need morality to restrict us? 

morality and education  become so necessary in the evolution of human society. because of the evil human nature.

Everyone can change their humanity by improving their self-cultivation, and even form a great personality in the end.

3.认识到人性本恶，其实这并不是人类的耻辱。这正好是我们人类不断进步的源泉，这是我们人类的闪光点，面向真理，我们应该正视它。正如顾城所说：““黑夜给了我一双黑色的眼睛，我去用它去寻找光明”，尽管我们性本恶，但是我们会用尽一生来寻找自我的价值。

Recognizing the evil of human nature, this is actually not a shame for human beings. This is precisely the source of our continuous human progress. This is the shining point of our humanity. Facing the truth, we should face it. As Gu Cheng said: "Night gave me  black eyes, but I use it to look for light." Although we are evil, we will use our whole life to find the value of ourselves.
